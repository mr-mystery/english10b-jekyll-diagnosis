            <p>
                “Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own person and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever did so for his pleasures… But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was complete. Think of it--I did not even exist!… It was Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty. Jekyll was no worse; he woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even make haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. And thus his conscience slumbered” (Stevenson 70-71).

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Dr. Jekyll found the act of harming others not as a necessity or a job but as a pleasurable act.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The compulsive need or want to harm or hurt is a common symptom of being a sociopath.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dr. Jekyll mentions how he is able to keep his conscience “asleep.”
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Dr. Jekyll still has a conscience, however, he can ignore it at times and manipulate it into being okay with his actions. Another trait of a sociopath.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dr. Jekyll can switch from being a charming respectful man to a vicious beast.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This type of switching personalities from good to bad in an instant is a very common sociopathic trait.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
