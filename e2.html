                “He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling; but he answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an ill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he broke out in a great flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentleman took a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to the earth” (Stevenson 23).

                    The compulsive desire to hurt or harm others for no evident reason that Dr. Jekyll displays is a socially defining trait for sociopaths.

                <li>
                    The lack of hesitation, remorse, and shame that was made apparent during the murder is also a primary sociopathic characteristic.

                    Dr. Jekyll burst into a violent creature in an instant for seemingly for reason.

                        <li>
                            The random urge to harm violently is one of the most common certifying traits that a sociopath has.
