                According to the paper “Sociopathy” by Kristin E. Landfield and Scott O. Lilienfeld, “Sociopathy is a clinical condition marked by a pattern of disturbed interpersonal, emotional, and behavioral functioning. It is characterized by remorselessness, manipulativeness, lack of concern for the welfare of others, deceit, shallow emotional experience, and poor impulse control. Sociopaths tend to be superficially charming and often make a good first impression on others. Nevertheless, they are typically egocentric, dishonest, and irresponsible, often without apparent motivation. They tend to be callous, externalize blame, and fail to learn from negative consequences… Sociopaths’ personality characteristics, such as poor impulse control and callousness, render many of them prone to violence” (Landfield et al).
